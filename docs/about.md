# about 

This project is still under heavy development, youâ€™re welcome to contribute or give feedback on [Github]( https://github.com/robalb/x86-64-playground)

This is a browser-based x86-64 assembly playground, powered by a WebAssembly port of the [blink](https://github.com/jart/blink/) emulator.</br>
Everything runs entirely client-side in your browser, there is no backend server. The whole runtime is just ~200Kb.
The assemblers provided by the webapp are the latest versions of `gnu as` and `Fasm`, emulated in blink. 

Upcoming features will include links for code sharing, breakpoints, and stack frames highlighting.
