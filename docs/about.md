# about 

This project is still under heavy development. You can contribute or provide feedback on [Github]( https://github.com/robalb/x86-64-playground)

This is a browser-based x86-64 assembly playground, powered by a WebAssembly port of the [blink](https://github.com/jart/blink/) emulator.</br>
Everything is running client-side in your browser, there is no backend server.
The assemblers provided by the webapp are the latest versions of `gnu as` and `Fasm`, emulated in blink.
